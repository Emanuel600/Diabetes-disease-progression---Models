# Diabetes-disease-progression---Models
Creating models to predict the progression of diabetes in patients based on 10 features

This model has very scattered data points, so I decided to stratify the data and predict on wich strata the target falls into

The 10 features mentiond are the following:
- age in years
- sex
- body mass index
- average blood pressure
- T-Cells (a type of white blood cells)
- low-density lipoproteins
- high-density lipoproteins
- thyroid stimulating hormone
- lamotrigine
- blood sugar level
